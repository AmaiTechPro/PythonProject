                       #OPERATORS
# 1. Arithmetic Operators -Used to perform simple calculationes include: addition(+),subtraction (-), multiplication(*), division(/), modulus(%).


x = 34

y = 2

print(x+y)

print(x-y)

print(x/y)

print(x*y)

print(x%y) #Modulus - Return the remainder after division




# 2. Comparison Operators - Used to compare values against each other and give either True or False since its a boolean

z = 60
w = 68


print(z>w)

print(z!=w)

print(w>=z)

print(z!=w)    #Not equal to comparison operator

print(z<w)

print(z<=w)

print(z==w)  #Equal to comparison operator

print(z==60)




# 3. Assignment Operators  -Used to assign values to variables
             #Example


number = 60
print(number)

number += 4  

 #Operator Precedence - The order in which operations get executed


print(number)

number *= 2

print(number)

output = 6-2+4*3

print(output)





# 4. Logical Operators  - Used where we have more than one condition to be executed at same time. They include: and, or, not

#N/B: And returns a true only if all conditions mentioned are true
#N/B: Or returns a true if any of the condition mentioned is true
#N/B: Not reverses a result i.e if the answer was true, it returns false
     
            #Examples;

print(50>16 and 67>20 and 45<30)          

print(50>16 or 67>20 or 45<30)

print(not(50>16 and  67>20 and  45<30))

print(not(19!=20))
